# Dungeon Crawler

Hello random person on my repo.
This is an attempt at a dungeon crawler-type adventure game, building upon a previous project I did in my studies at Lambda School.

The original version was a text-based game created in Python, where the player had the ability to move North, South, East and West through rooms, while collecting coins and occasionally coming across enemies.

### Version 0.0.1 Notes:
- Created game board
- Created player, with ability to move Up, Down, Right, and Left using arrow keys (or you can call it N,S,E,W if you're one of "those guys")
- Added bad guys. Currently just bounce around like the DVD logo if you paused an early-2000s movie for too long. They're also about as threatening as such
- Wall collision detection


### Features in Progress:
- Collision between bad guys and player (-Health)
- Scoring system (picking up coins)
- Randomly generated bad guys (varying speed/direction, varying damage)
- TBD

### Planned Features:
- Ability to traverse through different randomly-generated rooms
- Room structure (basically more walls besides the 4 in the cardinal directions)
- Smarter bad guys (not dvd logo screensaver-level intelligence)
- Powerups (regenerate health, move faster, deal more damage towards enemies)
- TBD
